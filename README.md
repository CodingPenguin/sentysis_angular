# Sentysis (frontend code)

Want to see how people feel about a YouTube video? Use [Sentysis](https://sentysis-angular.herokuapp.com) to view the sentiment of the audience!


## Info

Sentysis uses the [VADER Sentiment tool](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) to calculate each sampled comment's sentiment on a scale from -1.0 -- the most extreme negative -- to 1.0 -- the most extreme positive. The implementation of this library and many others can be seen [here](https://github.com/CodingPenguin/sentysis-flask).
